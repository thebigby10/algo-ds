## Algorithms
### Sorting
	✅ ~~Selection Sort~~  
  			Selection sort is that we select a position and find the number for that poisition. 
			That is why we first fix a position and then find the minimum number from that poisition to the end. 
	 		And Replace the minimum number on that poistion.	
	 		Time complexity: O(n^2)
	✅ ~~Bubble Sort~~  
 			In bubble sort we just pick two elements and swap them according to our condition of the sort.
		 	Time complexity: O(n^2)
 	☐ Insertion Sort  
	☐ Merge Sort 
 	☐ Quick Sort
